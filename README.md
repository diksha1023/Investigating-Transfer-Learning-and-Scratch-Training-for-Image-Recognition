# Investigating-Transfer-Learning-and-Scratch-Training-for-Image-Recognition
This project explores image classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal is to classify images into three categories - apparel, chairs, and footwear. The project covers:

Data collection and labeling
Splitting data into train, validation, and test sets
Building input pipelines with data augmentation
Fine-tuning a pretrained CNN model (ResNet50)
Training a CNN from scratch
This application consists of APIs which perform all the fundamental CRUD operations with user validation at every step.

## Data Collection and Labeling

- **Collected over 100 images per class (flowers, trees, pebbles) using a phone camera**
- **Labeled images and assigned category labels - 0 for apparel, 1 for chairs, 2 for footwear**
- **Developed a Python script to fetch and preprocess images belonging to different categories from local machine and convert to standardized format for prepreocessing and other machine learning tasks**
